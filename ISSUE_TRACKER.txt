CURRENT ISSUES

Canvas popup: when popup can't fit high or low, it should prefer low [RESOLVED 3/18]
Automatic transactions: Transactions getting added to block while modal is up
Layout: improve this in general

Right pane looks terrible
Button positioning
CanvPopUpData no longer works [RESOLVED 4/4]
Blocks should show Nonce

MouseTracker slightly off, hitbox biase up and left

Each Block object should have a canvas block

Miner should really "build" the block and then "broadcast" it.
Right now, since I need there to be a global createBlock() function
I will have the miner simply call that function

Add 2 <br> to modal so that new lines from reward and nonce don't heighten the modal [Sovled for reward not nonce]
Modal needs work

Added hasReward(block) function which checks for a null sender.

Make sender/receiver a dropdown menu and check amount for number
Disallow negative balances


Bring up with discussion:
	One of the interesting problems that I've faced is the intersection of OOP and blockchain.  Because of the nature of OOP, I've had to ask myself questions like: when is a block really a block?  When I reference block 8, what am I really referring to?  Whose job is it to broadcast transations, broadcast blocks, listen to blocks

CURRENT ISSUES

Canvas popup: when popup can't fit high or low, it should prefer low [RESOLVED 3/18]
Automatic transactions: Transactions getting added to block while modal is up
Layout: improve this in general

Right pane looks terrible
Button positioning
CanvPopUpData no longer works [RESOLVED 4/4]
Blocks should show Nonce

MouseTracker slightly off, hitbox biase up and left

Each Block object should have a canvas block

Miner should really "build" the block and then "broadcast" it.
Right now, since I need there to be a global createBlock() function
I will have the miner simply call that function

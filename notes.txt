1) String gets converted to array of ascii table byte values
2) Int array made of size x.
	0 <= str <= 55      x = 16 size: 56
	56 <= str <= 119    x = 32 size: 64
	120 <= str <= 183   x = 48 size: 64
	184 <= str <= 247   x = 64 size: 64
`	248 <= str <= 311   x = 80 size: 64
0-55 has size 56, all rest have 64
